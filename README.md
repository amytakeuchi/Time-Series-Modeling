# Time-Series-Modeling
## Introduction:
In today’s fast-paced and competitive manufacturing environment, organizations are increasingly shifting towards more effective, demand-driven supply chains to quickly adapt to changing market demands.
Demand forecasting plays a critical role in inventory management, as stock levels are directly influenced by demand predictions. Inaccurate demand estimation can result in significant financial losses for organizations.
This document aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the technical aspects and feasibility of the Rapid Predict modeling platform. It also explains how the platform delivers highly accurate forecasting results. Rapid Predict utilizes an additive modeling approach that captures the influence of multiple independent factors on the target (dependent) variable.
The document outlines the modeling methodology and the necessary preprocessing steps that must be completed prior to model development. The primary objective of this project is to model and forecast the dependent variable using the Box–Jenkins time series framework, with a particular focus on the ARIMA method. This is made possible by leveraging a large and consistent set of historical data.
